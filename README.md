# Four Directions Nourishment Guide (FDNG)

A culturally rooted, practical meal-planning web app inspired by Indigenous foodways. FDNG helps households plan a week of nourishing meals, scaled to household size and effort, while learning gentle health tidbits along the way. Pick items from 16 food subcategories across four directions/regions, then generate a clean pantry organizer and a one-click shopping list.

## Key features
- **Guided flow**: set household size → choose weekly intensity (¼, ½, 1×) → walk through categories and subcategories.
- **Indigenous regions lens**: foods organized to reflect four directions/regions and seasonal diversity.
- **Serving-aware cards**: each item has real-world purchase sizes (“12 oz frozen”, “3-lb bag”) mapped to app servings.
- **Smart split rules**: cross-listed foods (e.g., quinoa, plantains, parsnips) automatically allocate servings to multiple subcategories.
- **Quota targets**: per-subcategory targets scale by household × intensity; UI shows progress and locks when full.
- **Pre-queued credit**: items added in one section can “pre-queue” credit in another; the cards show that.
- **Pantry organizer**: accumulated selections roll up into a tidy per-item total for the week.
- **Shopping list**: generate a human-friendly list with the exact package sizes you picked.
- **Health tidbits**: lightweight, non-prescriptive notes about color diversity, fiber, fats, ferments, etc.
- **Local-first**: progress is saved to `localStorage` for instant, private persistence.

## How it works (short version)
- **Data**: Master lists (Vegetables, Fruits, Proteins, Grains/Roots/Seeds, Flavor & Health Enhancers) each with 4 subcategories × up to 20 items - with additions for indigenous regions.
- **Choices**: Each item has purchase-size options → servings (e.g., “Clamshell 10 oz → 7 servings”).
- **Targets**: Category and subcategory targets per person are defined in `DEFAULT_SPLITS`, then scaled and rounded up.
- **Progress**: `state.progress[subKey][itemName] = servings`. `shoppingDetails` records which sizes you picked.
- **Splits**: `SPLIT_RULES` route a single pick to multiple subkeys by weight (e.g., 50/50).
- **UI**: Cards are generated by `createItemCard()`; `renderSubcategory()` wires buttons to `routeAndAdd()`.
- **Locking**: `renderQuotaAndLocks()` greys out cards once the quota is met.
